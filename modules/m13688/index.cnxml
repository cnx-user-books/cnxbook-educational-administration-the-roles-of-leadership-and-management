(2006) published by Rowman &amp; Littlefield).</footnote></para>


<para id="id3132062">In this monograph the author offers the reader
a new perspective on an important, dynamic, and sometimes daunting
issue: managing successful school-based leadership. Organized
around the seven elements of art criticism, the author uses an
arts-based approach to weave together notions of research-based
leadership skills for successful school-based management with
standards of professional competence as represented by the
Interstate School Leaders Licensure Consortium (ISLLC) Standards
for School Leaders. More particularly, in each section of this
monograph the author presents a brief introduction of the
leadership construct as represented in the art metaphor more fully
described below. Then, the author suggests some possible
applications of the theoretical element to the real-world realities
of school leadership. Using a common-sense discussion on leadership
coupled with theory and research within an arts-based perspective,
the author encourages the reader to engage in the seemingly
persistent problems and old trials of school management from a new
perspective resulting in some refreshing possibilities for
supporting student achievement in schools. It is also the goal of
this arts-based approach that the reader might avoid the tendency
to reduce school-based management to formula and instead recognize
the complexity of leading and managing students and teachers within
the constantly evolving culture of today’s schools. As a result of
this qualitative inquiry into the nature of leadership for today’s
schools, the author invites a new vision for old assumptions in
schools, for teacher leadership, and for student learning. The
eventual product of such an investigation might be a new vision for
school leadership that is “more diversified and equitable” and one
that “can expand our conception of human cognition and help us
develop new forms of pedagogical practice” (Eisner, 1998, p.
245).</para>
<para id="id3090419">Leadership in the school building is at the
heart of school leadership. It is in the school building, the
halls, and classrooms that principals most directly impact teacher
behavior. The question that arises from a study leadership in the
school building is not about if principals can affect teaching
behavior but rather in what manner and to what extent principals
might affect teaching behavior, school environment, and ultimately
student learning (Stronge, 2002). And there is growing consensus in
the literature, most recently reported in the “School Leadership
Study” out of Stanford University (Davis, et al. 2005) that
successful school leaders can influence student achievement in at
least two important ways: (1) By selecting, supporting, and
developing effective teachers; (2) By managing, implementing, and
adjusting effective organizational environments. Other authors in
this book will devote more time to the first element of effective
leadership. In this monograph the author will focus on how
school-based leaders can effectively manage the competing, and
sometimes conflicting, demands of leading in today’s schools so as
to provide an organizational environment that encourages growth and
development on the part of students, teachers, and administrators.
The responsibility of managing a successful learning environment is
one shared by all stakeholders. If doing it alone is the plan for
the school principal, then research suggests that the leader is
less likely to maintain and support learning environments and is
more likely to “burn out” under the broadening responsibilities of
today’s accountability environment (Hargreaves, 2006). In light of
this harsh reality, in sections of this monograph the author will
offer school leaders ideas and possibilities for sharing the
awesome responsibility of managing effective schools.</para>
<para id="id3090424">In distributed leadership contexts, school
based leaders find ways for multiple stakeholders to participate in
the leadership, and thus successful management, of schools. This
notion of distributed leadership is most recently articulated by
Andy Hargreaves and Dean Fink (2006) in their book, Sustainable
Leadership. The principal, as school building leader, interacts
with teachers and students. It is at the school building where
teachers also provide leadership in the daily interactions with
their peers, with their students, and with their parents and other
stakeholders. And, it is in the daily interactions with students
that teachers and principals can encourage students to take on
leadership. The literature regarding successful school based
management continues to grow both in breadth and depth and if my
graduate students are any indicator of today’s leaders, school
based stakeholders yearn for specific and guiding principles for
how to manage today’s learning environments. In very obvious ways
it is at school building level where the tug between theory and
practice is most powerful and most often confrontational
(Hargreaves &amp; Fink, 2006). Although establishing theoretical
context is essential in framing a theory of leadership, principals
often consider such discussions meaningless in helping them make
sense of daily pressures and demands of schooling. What principals
want is a theory of school building leadership that can speak
honestly and directly to the challenges of helping teachers and
students achieve in an atmosphere of standards and accountability
(Stronge, 2002).</para>
<para id="id3103199">A Way of Thinking</para>
<para id="id3103203">Over the past few years the author has
investigated leadership in the schools from an arts-based research
methodology. Based on his own experiences, conversations with
leaders, and research, he grew to be suspicious that leading was in
fact more than just good management. Indeed, it was management but
also much more. There was this sense of art, not just craft, among
the very best leaders. For example, the author began to discover
that traditional assessment methods for instructional leadership
were often quite effective in addressing narrowing teaching
functions but failed to grasp the nuances, subtleties, and totality
of successful classrooms (Blumberg, 1989; Pajak, 2003). From a very
different point of departure, Stronge (2002) also concludes that
school leader practice has little to no effect on teacher behavior
and subsequently student learning. According to Stronge, principals
managed to do the craft of observations and provide some evidence
of what they saw. They often completed this task with short,
drop-in visits. But what was missing from this type of management
was the fact that little change in teacher or student behavior came
about as a result of the observation. In some ways, according to
Stronge, principals failed to address the complexity of the teacher
function. Indeed, leading schools and supporting teachers required
school principals to do much more than managing. Successful schools
were places where craft and art were practiced.</para>
<para id="id3119962">At this point, the author needs to ask the
reader to consider a slight shift in thinking. Instead of trying to
compete with the reader’s assumptions and practices regarding
school leadership, assumptions that emerge from powerful and
successful experience no doubt, and instead of trying to convince
the reader that the answer is “this” instead of “that,” the author
wants to encourage the reader to engage in “and” thinking. Recently
when working with a high school principal, the author had this
exchange: “I noticed that your teachers did not feel you visited
their classrooms often enough. How might you respond to them?” The
principal, in obvious frustration, responded “Yes, I know I need to
do more than I have been doing but I cannot find time because of
all the discipline referrals.” The principal was doing what the
author affectionately calls “Yes . . . but” thinking. How many
times might one say in a day’s time “Yes, I could get to that job
but I cannot find time” or “Yes, I need to be in halls greeting
students but I just cannot get out of the office and all the
paperwork.” This type of thinking tends to be defeatist in nature
as it builds obstacles instead of possibilities. A different way to
consider our thinking is what the author calls “and” thinking. For
example, “Yes, I need to be in the halls more often and I will
distribute some of the paperwork so that I can find time to do it.”
In reality, individuals tend to find time for those things that
matter most. If being in the halls greeting students was really
important, then they would create a world where that could happen.
The shift from “yes. . . but” thinking to “and” thinking is a
subtle but powerful change. Such a shift represents a change in
values and priorities, indeed a paradigmatic change. In like
fashion, when considering the work in this monograph the author
wants to challenge the reader to engage in “and” thinking and not
“yes. . . but” thinking. Instead of looking for the absolute answer
in this work, consider the possibility that the content offers
another way to be successful; not the only one. Now let the reader
put that type of thinking to work as he or she prepares for the
more specific discussion of successful management of
schools.</para>
<para id="id3121676">Arts-Based Research as a Way of Seeing</para>
<para id="id3121680">Is quantitative research the best choice for
discovering truth? Or, is qualitative research the best
methodology? In some traditional debates, the argument might follow
something like this: “Yes, qualitative research offers some answers
to questions on teacher performance but the real answers are in
quantitative analyses.” Or, “Yes, quantitative research has been
around a long time but it is qualitative research that most clearly
offers the best picture of teaching.” Both examples tend to create
obstacles and not possibilities. The alternative conversation might
flow something like this: “Quantitative research has certainly
withstood the test of time with its rigor and analysis and
qualitative research provides another perspective and level of
analysis on the same behaviors.” This type of thinking encourages
possibilities, not obstacles.</para>
<para id="id3133350">A similar dichotomy emerges regarding the
nature of effective teaching. The debate over whether effective
leadership is art or craft, or if effective teaching is technical
in nature or aesthetic, is important and often lively. Indeed,
there is growing research that supports the notion that teaching,
when done well, is both art and craft, technical and aesthetic,
personal and clinical (Lewis, 2004; Newmann et al., 1996; Blumberg,
1989; Eisner, 1983). When individuals begin coupling their thinking
that teaching is both art and craft with a growing presence of
arts-based research that seeks to extend the notion of what is
meaningful, then they can begin to see the value of “and” thinking.
In fact, teacher effectiveness research findings support the notion
that students learn best from teachers who can be characterized as
managing both the craft and the artistic dimensions of effective
teaching. So as the reader engages in the journey of what makes for
successful school based management, the author wants to implore him
or her to engage in “and” thinking so that he or she can begin
building power bridges for successful schooling and fewer
walls.</para>
<para id="id3736795">Toward defining, evaluating, and thus
understanding the leadership function in the school building the
author will ground the following discussion in an arts-based
research theoretical approach (Eisner, 1998; Barone &amp; Eisner,
1997). The arts-based research format seemed appropriate for this
investigation because as a form of qualitative research, arts-based
investigations can more readily gain “a firm foothold” on the
nature of human interactions embedded in school cultures (Eisner,
1998). The function of successful leadership is characterized as
practice that acknowledges, embraces, and develops the relational
nature of schooling. That relation may be student to student,
student to teacher, student to subject, teacher to teacher, teacher
to leader, leader to community, community to school, and on and on.
At some level, all successful schooling is relational in nature. In
addition, qualitative thought is always a component of interaction
between individuals (Eisner, 1998) and coming to terms with the
nature of relationships is central to the human experience. So, as
readers come to terms with the fact that leadership encompasses
both technical and aesthetic dimensions, craft and art, then they
can begin to understand that an arts-based approach is entirely
appropriate as one way to understand effective school leadership
and management of schools.</para>
<para id="id3553061">As the author begins the work from a
qualitative theory perspective (Eisner, 1998; Barone, 1998) that
leadership may be viewed as an art form and that it can be
described as interactive and relational, a sort of choreography of
human understanding, then the reader might do well to develop a
mechanism for “seeing” it as an artist might view a painting or a
choreographer a dance (Kelehear, 2006). For the purposes of this
investigation, that mechanism comes in the form of the elements of
art and it is the goal of this monograph to help the reader begin
developing some facility with aesthetic dimensions of leadership in
the school building. Specifically, the author will use the elements
of art to help frame the discussion of school-based leadership in
this monograph. Just as the elements of art can assist a viewer of
art describe, analyze, interpret, or evaluate a work, those same
elements can help a viewer of leadership art describe, analyze,
interpret, or evaluate the management of schools. When individuals
continue to view leadership narrowly, as a function of management
and formula, then they narrow their view of leadership from an art
of human experience and understanding to a strategy for control and
manipulation of personnel. By applying the language of art
individuals can construct a lens through which the nature of one’s
humanity begins to become clearer.</para>
<para id="id3115868">Elements of Art as a Way of
Understanding</para>
<para id="id3083765">The elements of art are line, value, shape,
form, space, color, and texture. In the first part of each section
the author will offer an artist’s definition of each element. In an
attempt to help the reader connect the arts-based frame to the
leadership frame, in the second part of each discussion the author
will briefly describe the leadership themes and possible
implications. In the third part of each section, and indeed a key
part of the entire discussion, the author will highlight key
research initiatives and findings relative to that particular
function. In the final analysis, the reader can have a helpful and
grounded overview of what makes for successful school-based
leadership in today’s schools.</para>
<para id="id3085180">Because the author is framing the leadership
discussion in an arts-based theoretical approach, some additional
consideration about that approach is necessary. Similarly, as the
author organizes the leadership discussion with a corresponding and
appropriate language of art, in the form of elements of art, then
that format can help the reader to understand the nature of the
form. Eisner (1985) has explored the implications of this challenge
of leadership as art most fully in his work, The Educational
Imagination. A few of the more notable scholars who also looked to
the arts to provide useful models to better understand and improve
educational practice include S. L. Lightfoot (1983; 1997), P.
Jackson (1998), T. Barone (1988), and A. Blumberg (1989). Within
art, the author suggests that disciplines of aesthetics and
criticism in general provide us a structure for
understanding.</para>
<para id="id3119830">Dewey (1934) conceived aesthetics as the
branch of philosophy that allows one to analyze the way he or she
looks at the qualities of the world and assign value to
experiences. Dewey’s aesthetics provides a theoretical construct
for thinking about leadership. Individuals are engaging in
aesthetic thinking when they use their perceptions, sensations, and
imagination to gain insight into what they might feel and
understand about the world (Greene, 2001). Furthermore, Dewey
(1934) implies that aesthetic refers to one’s first critical
reflection on objects he or she experiences. What is especially
important is that experiences stem from attention to qualitative
relationships. Through these reflections one’s world and the wonder
of life begin to take on deeper meaning. Priorities become clear.
Important events assume an appropriate relationship with daily
challenges. As these experiences first occur outside of language
and the expected constructions of the world, by reflecting on them
they offer individuals opportunities for understanding. This type
of reflective analysis of experience is an integral part of
critical theory through which one examines his or her own practice
and habits of mind.</para>
<para id="id3743836">In cultivating this sensitivity one begins
taking on an aesthetic task. One begins answering the questions:
What is of value? What is meaningful? What is moving about a given
situation? It is through attending to the smallest nuances of art
or life that one begins to transcend to a more attentive form of
existence. He or she moves to a plane of existence that releases
imagination, passions, curiosity, and extraordinary circumstances.
It is Dewey’s view of reflection that leads one to the notion of
critical theory as a vehicle for understanding and valuing. Dewey
was adamant that this form of aesthetic experience as antithetical
to the appreciation of beauty. Dewey’s aesthetics is an active form
or mental engagement with the world – not a detached, coldly
objective appraisal.</para>
<para id="id3726194">When one begins to recognize that leadership
is inseparable from human interaction, then one begins to
understand that leadership is more about listening to and
understanding each other rather than devising a checklist of
behaviors. Leadership is engagement, not detachment or mere
observation. The benefit is that one begins to appreciate the
nuances and subtleties that come with managing and leading people.
Being able to engage in this critique of human interaction and
motivation allows one to view leadership as an art rather than a
formula. It is interpretative, relative, and sophisticated. As
such, it requires a comparable methodology for understanding:
aesthetics, critical theory, and leadership as art. Following the
guidance of aesthetics and critical theory, one can begin to view
the art of leadership through the lenses of the elements of art.
Just as the elements provide art observers with a language for
critique, those same elements can help frame the critique of
leadership.</para>
<para id="id3169241">Borrowing this notion from the world of art,
the author will use the elements to describe specific, observable
attributes of the art of leadership. As mentioned above, the
elements are line, shape, form, space, color, value, and texture.
In terms of understanding leadership, the author suggests that the
elements will offer building blocks for understanding basic
leadership skills. The author takes each of the elements as
discrete parts of the leadership function. As the reader becomes
more skilled at describing leadership, then he or she will also
notice that it is difficult and artificial to see the elements as
“stand alone” skills of leadership. Rather, the reality is more
about one element playing a primary role while other elements
function in a supportive capacity. Together, they support the
leader’s ability to work through a given situation.</para>
<para id="id3175522">As one begins to rely on elements, one begins
to come to terms with what is seen, felt, and sensed. Understanding
leadership becomes an aesthetic process. One not only knows it
cognitively and conceptually, but also emotionally and personally.
And leadership is skill, emotion, and personal. Leadership, when it
is done well, is an art and applying the standards of the seven
elements of art might help one to begin to know what leadership
does, what it looks like, what it feels like, what makes it work.
Just as with art, school leadership is not about finding a “magic
formula.” Given the complexity of people and situations that
leaders confront, it is no small wonder that no prescription
exists. But, when one sees something work at this school or that
system, one may often try to assign the success to a single
strategy or individual. The reality is, however, that the success
comes from the interdependence and interaction of several
leadership functions­­ in much the same way that the elements might
contribute to the interpretation of an artwork.</para>
<para id="id3127968">Effective School Building Management: A Way
for Learning</para>
<para id="id3127974">The elements of art are the basic visual
symbols in the language of art. They provide a specific, and often
concrete, vocabulary for describing art. The elements are line,
shape, form, space, color, and texture. The elements of art help
create a view, a perception and a vision of effective management in
the school building. Within each school, all seven elements may be
present. The relative perceptivity of the various elements in a
school, however, can be very different depending on changing needs,
varying times of the year, or changes within the district. The
constant, however, is that in effective schools, and by association
in effective leadership, the seven elements provide a specific
mechanism for reflecting on practice and for navigating the often
difficult choices that come with educating our children for
successful citizenship.</para>
<para id="id3181602">In the table below [See Table #1], the author
offers an alignment of the ISLLC to the Elements of Art and the
particular Leadership Dimension embedded in each element. In the
discussion to follow, the author will offer each element, an artist
definition, a leadership perspective, and then relevant research as
a way to frame the key research and best practices for successful
school building leadership.</para>
<para id="element-748"><media id="idm957824" alt=""><image src="../../media/table1.GIF" mime-type="image/gif"/></media></para><para id="id3118415">Element # 1:</para>
<para id="id3155119">Line: A long narrow mark or stroke made on or
in a surface</para>
<para id="id3204219">The Artist’s View:</para>
<para id="id3174643">Artists recognize the important contribution
line brings to a holistic understanding of a given work. Lines can
be vertical, horizontal, diagonal, curvilinear, and zigzagged. When
artists vary the line’s length, width, texture, direction, and
degree of curve they can multiply the visual impact of a work of
art. For example, vertical lines convey height and inactivity.
Vertical lines also express stability, dignity, poise, stiffness,
and formality. Imagine how vertical lines on the side of a building
will make the building look taller, more stable. By contrast
horizontal lines are static. They express peace, rest, quiet, and
stability. Horizontal lines can help make one feel content,
relaxed, and calm. Diagonal and zigzag lines suggest activity. They
communicate action, movement, and tension. Diagonal lines also seem
to work against gravity and create a pull and tension that can be
uncomfortable. Curved lines also express activity. Spiral curves
around a central point are hypnotic and tend to draw the eye to the
center. Zigzag lines in an artwork help to create a feeling of
confusion. Clearly an element as simple as line can have a powerful
affect on the message of an artwork.</para>
<para id="id3178440">ISLLC Standard #1: A school administrator is
an educational leader who promotes the success of all students by
facilitating the development, articulation, implementation, and
stewardship of a vision of learning that is shared and supported by
the school community.</para>
<para id="id3178445">A Leadership Perspective:</para>
<para id="id3186859">For school leaders, line means to be clear
about boundaries and parameters. Successful school leaders
communicate expectations for students and staff. They are
consistent with the application of that understanding. Few things
are as demoralizing to a staff as to see the leader apply rules
inconsistently. The school draws stability, dignity, and poise from
the consistent and fair application of rules and
expectations.</para>
<para id="id3200863">Line also serves to remind leadership of the
important role of mission and vision. When teachers are clear about
where the school is going and how they are going to get there, then
they begin to understand their role in the process. Conversely,
when the direction of the school seems flat, or horizontal, then
the learning atmosphere becomes stagnant and unproductive.</para>
<para id="id3189013">Finally, line informs leadership about the
delineating negotiable and non-negotiable boundaries. If a school
committee is to decide a particular issue, then effective
leadership is clear about what is open to conversation and what is
not. For a committee to work at an issue and submit a solution only
to discover that the answer was not one of the options can
frustrate good intentions.</para>
<para id="id3167384">In a recent article regarding organizational
culture, Patterson and Kelehear (2003) assert: “Even with the best
of intentions, organizations can’t devote equal attention to all of
the important culture values. Something’s got to give when various
culture values compete for your organization’s time and energy” (p.
35). Without attending to the assumptions and beliefs in managing
the school, leaders run the risk of developing “organizational
blind spots [that] represent undetected misalignment between what
the organization says it values vs. what it really values, what it
says it does vs. what it really does, or what it really does vs.
what it actually values” (p. 35). Although there continues to be
some debate over the relationship between culture and leadership,
the debate is not that the two do not impact each other but the
degree to which one has influence over the other. In the NASA
article referenced above, the conclusion of the investigating
committee on the Columbia disaster was that leadership absolutely
effects organization culture. In fact, the committee asserted
unequivocally that leaders create culture and leaders alter
cultures. When what is valued, what is said to be of value, and
what is valued in practice are not consistent, then leadership has
created a dysfunctional organizational culture destined for
failure.</para>
<para id="id3200789">Bolman and Deal (2003) assert that leadership
plays a key role in providing symbolism for what the organizational
culture values. Whether in terms of providing symbols (e.g.,
clothing, school cultures, trophy cases), providing vision and
mission statements (e.g., in writing, on walls, in shared
language), sharing organizational stories and myths (e.g.,
founders’ day, past heroes), maintaining rituals (e.g., pep
rallies, senior lunch rooms, seasonal concerts), or in other
symbolic ways, leaders help craft a shared perspective on what
matters most in the school and help build a culture that supports
those articulated values.</para>
<para id="id3200793">Starratt (1991; 1994; 2003; 2004), Sergiovanni
(1992; 2005), Strike, et al. (1998), Fullan (2003), Buzzelli &amp;
Johnston (2002), Cooper (1998), and others have articulated that
school leadership has a responsibility of not only establishing a
shared vision but that they are to create a shared ethical vision
of behavior among all constituents in the learning community. That
is to say that an effective leader helps others know how
interaction among teachers, parents, and students is to occur,
helps others know what to do in moments of confrontation and
crisis, and helps others know how to engage each other in matters
relevant to student concerns whether academic, emotional, or
physical in nature.</para>
<para id="id3185530">When the rules of interaction and roles are
clear, then individuals reduce the chances for misunderstanding
that otherwise might infect healthy organizational environments.
Sometimes leaders like to refer to their schools as families, a
comfortable analogy upon first view. There is, however, something
dysfunctional about such a comparison. In a family environment,
there are often very clear distinctions between what parents may do
and what children can do. When we apply the family metaphor to
schooling, then we run the risk of establishing very clear
expectations for the parent (i.e., principal) and the children
(i.e., teachers and students) and there is something very unhealthy
about such an organizational culture. Thus, making expectations
clear is only part of the challenge. Treating each other fairly, so
as to encourage a shared stewardship of learning and a shared
responsibility for what happens during a school day, is an
important part of establishing the element of line in an
effectively managed school environment. An element closely related
to that of line in effective school management is that of value
where the leadership creates a culture of mutual growth among
students and teachers alike.</para>
<para id="id3172706">Element #2:</para>

object</para>
<para id="id3205797">The Artist’s View:</para>
<para id="id3204478">Value is the art element that describes the
relative darkness or lightness of an object in a drawing or
painting. How much value a surface has is dependent on how much
light is reflected. If there is an absence of light, the surface
will be dark; and if there is much light, the surface becomes
lighter. There are many ways that artists create value. For
example, when one looks at a dollar bill, one may see an entire
artwork that is composed of tiny lines. The artist or the engraver
uses lines to create value. The closer and more plentiful the line
appears in a space, the darker the value. In turn the less line in
a given space there is less value, and the space appears lighter.
In fact, value is related to all the elements and is often
understood best in association with other elements.</para>

administrator facilitates a vision and promotes success of all

and instructional program conducive to student learning and staff

<para id="id3172350">A Leadership Perspective:</para>
<para id="id3204079">For school leadership, value represents the
“light” that emerges from daily activities that reflects attention
to what matters most. Often times in schools individuals can fail
to recognize, or to remember, what is most important. They
earnestly engage in any number of activities that seem important,
for the moment, but cast little light on the picture of what or who
they are. In other words, their actions do not adequately support
their most central, core values.</para>
<para id="id3170439">Core values are not observations, perceptions,
or operating rules. They are things individuals believe to be
extremely important. They are characterized by descriptors such as
fundamental, guiding, philosophical, and pointing the way. Core
values help answer such questions as: Who are we? What do we stand
for? What business are we really in? What is important to us? Where
do we want to go in our preferred future?</para>
<para id="id3170442">Accompanying core values are “we will”
statements. “We will” statements are specific, concrete,
observable, measurable actions that support the philosophy that
emerges from core values. In many instances, the “we will”
statements are single efforts such as special events or activities.
In other cases, however, “we will” statements involve multi-year
approaches to complex and systemic issues.</para>
<para id="id3163247">When individuals consider leading a school, it
is important to note the relative importance of the many activities
that come in a school day. Value in leadership means defining what
matters most so that all can begin to understand what the business
of school is. As individuals articulate the core values, the
guiding and philosophical principles, then all decisions can emerge
from a shared belief. The synergistic effect is that they can begin
putting their energy toward specific values, avoiding the ad hoc
decisions characteristic of many schools. What the student,
teacher, leader, and community see reflected in the activities of
the school is a value-driven institution with a vision for where it
is going rather than an event-driven body. Just as with value in
art, core values speak to all other elements of leadership. When
done well, core values become the guiding principles for all
decisions and help create school space characterized as a place for
authentic learning and caring.</para>
<para id="id3161645">In watching the students and teacher work
together one trait consistently emerges as essential to a caring
and authentic school: Empathy. Empathy can become value in that it
represents a guiding principle for the school culture. Empathy is
that interpersonal quality that allows one to know the feelings of
another (Kelehear, 2001; 2002). As students work with each other,
as teachers work with the students, and as the principal assists
the teacher, the level of empathy present defines the qualitative
relationship. And at the same time, the participants cultivate a
sense of caring in the relationship as they began to understand the
commitment in working together toward shared goals. In as much as
caring becomes a part of the school climate, the relationships
become more substantive and paying attention to each other becomes
the order of the day. A process by which we can begin to shape a
positive school culture might begin as school based leaders realign
the role of four key players in the school day: the student, the
teacher, the leader, and the curriculum.</para>
<para id="id3179616">Given the powerful influence on standardized
assessments, federal mandates, and state-level oversight, it is
easy to reduce students to input/output items rather than see them
in their humanity. In his book Schools Without Failure, William
Glasser (1969) emphasizes that allowing grades to create an
incentive for learning has, in fact, a contracting effect on what
is learned. The more that grades, and by extension standardized
tests, are emphasized the more that students want to know what is
exactly on the test, and only those items on the test. Students
come to believe that any other information can become an obstacle
or a distraction to getting the grade, and thus should be ignored
(p. 65). Effective school leadership will recognize that there is a
role for grades and standardized testing. Indeed, they can help
provide accountability for learning certain bits of information.
But to rely solely on grades and traditional assessments is
painfully shortsighted.</para>
<para id="id3155279">School based leaders can build a school
culture that shines light on authentic student learning and staff
professional growth. One way to construct such a climate is to
place emphasis on what Ted Sizer (1992), in his book Horace's
School, calls exhibitions. This type of assessment helps encourage
students to bring together facts and basic learning to create a new
understanding– what Mortimer Adler (p. 29) called maieutic
expression. A word of Greek origin, maieutic is loosely translated
as "giving birth." Just as an artist might be able to use the
elements of art to paint a still life, it is the artist's use of
those "skills" and the simultaneous interpretation of that object
through experience and feelings that can give birth to a new
perspective, a new understanding, a deeper cognition (Eisner,
2001). Similarly, other aspects of the curriculum could have the
same consequence.</para>
<para id="id3177828">School leaders and teachers must help students
come to command facts and information, the kind of information that
is readily assessed through pencil and paper tests and standardized
assessments. Quickly, however, students begin to use the newly
acquired information in applications of the concepts through
repeated practice and coaching; just as the artist begins to
command the elements of art. Although many very good teachers might
guide students to this level of mastery, this is not enough.
Through demonstrations, exhibitions, or other public forums,
teachers should encourage students to create a new, deeper
understanding, a maieutic expression. The student's knowledge and
understanding takes on what Eisner (1994) calls "a social dimension
in human experience" (p.39). But teachers and students will only be
able to do such authentic practice when the environment in general,
and school leadership in particular, supports such practice.</para>
<para id="id3200627">In a recent study of an arts magnet school
(Bender-Slack, Miller, &amp; Burroughs, 2006)researchers observed
teaching practice in the standard curricular areas such as
mathematics, English, social studies, and science. The researchers
also followed the students to the classrooms for visual and
performing arts. The purpose of their observations was to ascertain
the degree to which an arts-infused curriculum was being
implemented. The observation and data collection were conducted in
an art magnet school; the same type of place that one might think
that arts-infused practice would be the norm, not the exception. To
the surprise of the researchers, teaching practice among the core
subjects areas remained traditional (i.e., teacher centered,
lecture formats, seat work) and void of arts-infused practices.
Similarly, the art teachers rarely embraced the standard curriculum
in their delivery of instruction. Keeping in mind that the mission
statement of the school emphasized an arts-based,
multi-disciplinary approach to learning, the researchers discovered
that the school had changed leadership several times in the
previous five years. The message for the researchers was clear,
where leadership fails to support innovative practice for teachers
and authentic performances for students then leadership could not
expect for the school to be any different than one that might be
characterized as unimaginative and traditional (Bender-Slack,
Miller, &amp; Burroughs, 2006).</para>
<para id="id3746352">Understanding the teacher's role in developing
authentic learning experiences is essential to supporting a school
culture focused on teacher and student learning. The traditional
view that the teacher is the conveyor of knowledge and truth is
only partially correct. Newmann and Wehlage (1995) and Newmann,
Marks and Gamoran (1996) assert that students learn best when
teachers are engaged in authentic pedagogy design and provide
learning experiences that: 1) encourage students to build new
knowledge, 2) embrace and support disciplined inquiry, and 3) have
value beyond the school setting. Creating such authentic pedagogy
supports knowledge that students believe is more meaningful and
relevant than what might be expressed in traditional pencil and
paper tests that seek rote answers to prescribed questions. This
position is not to suggest that knowledge memorized is always an
undesirable product of schooling. The practice alone, however, is
wholly insufficient. Rather, and in keeping with a position
supported by Dewey (1934) and more recently embraced by
constructivist philosophy (e.g., Lambert et al., 2003), when
students begin to engage subject matter in meaningful ways, then
they begin to construct meaning of and establish value in the
school curriculum. The ownership of problems in the curriculum
moves from teacher to student. In other words, instead of a teacher
presenting problems to students to be addressed, students move to
engage problems (i.e., sources of dissonance) that compel them to
resolve apparent inconsistencies in their previous understanding.
An important part of this authentic perspective posited by Newmann
and Wehlage (1995) and Newmann, Marks and Gamoran (1996) is that
authentic pedagogy supports meaningful, personal, and private
reflection on the part of students and teachers alike. In essence,
they are addressing qualitative relationships and fine grained
distinctions (Eisner, 2002) between what they knew to be true
before the learning experience compared to what they are coming to
know based on the personal construction of new knowledge. This
intrapersonal reflection then becomes part of a classroom that
embraces the aesthetics of learning. As students continue to seek
meaning and purpose in the new knowledge, then they move to open
discourse with their peers and teachers.</para>
<para id="id3666644">In order for teachers to encourage authentic
expression from student and for teachers themselves to experiment
with what works for different types of students, there will need to
be a special type of leadership. The role of the principal is to
protect jealously the learning environment, to guard the classroom
as a safe place where teachers and students may take risks, and to
promote an atmosphere of openness and authentic communication.
Embedded throughout this vision for leadership is the pivotal role
of trust (Kelehear, 2001).</para>
<para id="id3175053">Through open communication, shared decision
making, and mutual respect, the school will model the
characteristics of a pluralistic, democratic society. There will be
many teaching styles; ideally, as many as there are different
learning needs. The leadership will celebrate those differences
while maintaining high expectations for student learning. Allowing
teachers to utilize different techniques does not free them from
responsibility for student learning. In fact, the opposite is true.
In as much as the principal allows for teachers to choose
strategies for student learning, then the principal can hold those
teachers responsible for what happens in the classroom. The
question to the teacher will not be "Did you teach well today?" but
rather, "Did the students learn today?" As Sizer (1984; 1992)
reminds us, if the answer to the second question is “yes,” then the
answer to the first question is “yes.” Said differently, one cannot
have taught well in the absence of student learning!</para>
<para id="id3175058">Authentic leadership would seek to construct a
context where the teachers and principal work together to form a
school culture that is focused on student achievement and engaged
citizenship. The teachers and principal would be clear about
student achievement and teaching excellence as essential core
values. They would attend only to those activities that support and
foster student and, as an extension, teacher successes (Patterson,
1993, p. 37-52).</para>
<para id="id3203823">The nature of leadership would be such that it
too is not a prescription. Rather, leadership in the authentic
school would celebrate children's uniqueness and the art of
teaching. Similarly, teachers and principal alike would understand
that leadership is in itself an artwork under construction. Just as
the principal celebrates and promotes the uniqueness of teachers,
the teachers would likewise support and challenge the principal to
be open, authentic, and a risk-taker in making decisions that
support the core values of the school.</para>
<para id="id3185231">Authentic learning spaces emerge when leaders
create opportunities for teachers and students to reflect on
experiences in qualitative ways. Central to the construction of
such a space requires leadership to design a curriculum in which
all the disciplines are embraced as complementary and supportive
and not in competition for space and budget. In essence, successful
school management becomes a process of providing opportunities for
meaning-making for teachers and student alike. The final assessment
of our schools might be as Eisner (2001) states, “It’s what
students do with what they learn when they can do what they want to
do that is the real measure of educational achievement” (p. 370).
If our students do not continue after school the things about which
we talk in school, then we may have failed them.</para>
<para id="id3100452">In today’s schools, leaders are confronted
with the harsh reality that effective teaching and leadership
involve experiment, reflection, and refinement and that effective
school based leadership supports such practices. Today’s school
cultures must be places that allow teachers and leaders to
recognize their own humanity and that of their students (Palmer,
1998). Both teachers and students ought to be allowed to fail and
leaders must provide for them support in their mistakes. School
leadership can begin, thus, to acknowledge that out of the
diversity of ideas, great wonders can emerge. Indeed, Steinbeck
(1955) reminds us, "teaching might even be the greatest of the arts
since the medium is the human mind and spirit” (p.7). Today’s
school building leader must have the strength of will and the
commitment to doing what matters most: attending to the needs of
the children. The best way to achieve this goal is for school
leadership to allow for the art that is teaching where authentic
learning and caring for each other carry the day. Being clear about
value and the light it sheds on practice is indeed a crucial part
of successful school based management.</para>

<para id="id3119717">A Leadership Perspective:</para>
<para id="id3119722">Schools have a shape, a smell, a look, a feel.
As we imagine our elementary school days, we create physical images
that capture our learning experiences. Similarly, as we walk into
the elementary school just before lunch to smell the bread cooking
in the dining hall, we are taken back to some of our favorite (or
maybe not so favorite) memories of schooling. Whatever the quality
of those memories, they are certainly vivid. We watch the big
yellow school bus traveling down the road and wonder about the
children in that lovely “monster” of a vehicle. These images are
not about instruction. They are about the other things that inform
our memories and have deeply affected our lives. Even though they
are not instruction, they are important to the successful school.
They are the shape of schooling.</para>
<para id="id3529243">Management is the shape of schools. We manage
budgets, discipline, community relations, and personnel. These are
not the things that should be our focus in schools but they are
exactly the matters with which we must deal so that we might teach
children. And, the degree to which a leader can handle aspects of
time management, scheduling, random but daily details, personnel
management, parent conferencing, and community relations will
determine the level of success for the students at that school. Of
the management details, supervision of personnel is the most
rewarding, demanding, and exhausting. Successful leaders find ways
to be instructional leaders by offering supervision, staff
development, remediation, and when necessary termination. But
during the whole process of management, leaders struggle to balance
being compassionate and supportive with being clinical and direct
with personnel. Both sets of skills are necessary, but it is the
rare leader who can do them both well. Effective leaders understand
how to shape the modes of management to support the business of
student learning.</para>
<para id="id2962000">Recently, while involved in staff development
for assistant principals, it became clear to the author that the
systemic configuration in the schools inhibited, or prohibited, the
proper application of leadership functions. Put bluntly, school
leadership has assumed so many different roles in the building that
some leaders felt they were not doing any of the jobs very well. In
fact, based on recent research with practicing assistant principals
(Kelehear, 2005) the author and participants reconstructed the
leadership position so that myriad responsibilities might be
separated into two categories, for two different positions. Instead
of one position in charge of both management and leadership, there
would be the Manager of Programs (MP) for administration and the
Instructional Leader (IL) for instructional supervision. Being in
charge in today’s schools continues to be a daunting task. Given
the competing demands of federal mandates, state assessments,
standardized-testing schedules, shrinking revenue streams, and the
like, it is no small wonder that children and teaching somehow get
lost in the shuffle.</para>
<para id="id2962004">It is clear from the literature (Sergiovanni,
1999; Smith &amp; Piele, 1989; Glickman, Gordon, &amp; Ross-Gordon,
2004; Sergiovanni &amp; Starratt, 2002; Fullan, 2001; Starratt,
2004; Robbins &amp; Alvy, 2003) that principals are called upon to
do a myriad of jobs. It is a challenging task for principals to
offer instructional leadership and also manage the other competing
responsibilities. In much the same way as a teacher must be a
successful manager of classroom behavior in order to be able to
teach, the school leader must be able to manage the school so that
instruction can take place. But to ask one person to manage all the
business of schooling and also to conduct instructional supervision
might be an unrealistic expectation. In working with 14
administrators, the author began to imagine that by separating the
instructional supervision function from the principal’s
responsibility, then maybe another teacher leader could more fully
supervise instruction in our schools (Kelehear, 2005). The role of
instructional supervision would rest with someone whose primary
responsibility was instructional development. Managing all other
affairs of schooling such as budgets, parent conferences, and
discipline would reside with the principal’s position. The Manager
of Programs (MP) was responsible for all matters of school
governance and management with the exception of instructional
leadership.</para>
<para id="id3192410">The Instructional Leader (IL) would conduct
all instructional programs relative to evaluation, supervision,
induction, remediation, and instructional staff development. This
job would carry with it a supervisory supplement that would
recognize the lead teacher’s supervisory responsibilities. The
school would have an instructional committee whose responsibility
it would be to select an IL who may or may not be a member of the
committee. The IL’s appointment would be 3 years. The IL would
function as a part of the instructional committee but leadership
within the committee would reside with a different person. One way
to imagine the organization is to imagine an elected school board
with an appointed superintendent. The committee will have
representatives from grade levels for elementary schools or from
subject areas for high schools. Middle schools would have
instructional committees drawn from teams.</para>
<para id="id3192414">For matters relative to evaluation, the IL
would have the primary responsibility for making “judgments
concerning the overall quality of the teacher’s performance and the
teacher’s competence in carrying out assigned duties as well as
provide a picture of the quality of teaching performances across
the professional staff” (Nolan, 2003). These data will be collected
as part of the teacher’s overall evaluation in terms of retention,
tenure, and promotion. The actual process for making employment
decisions is described later in this paper.</para>
<para id="id3173616">Within the context of supervision, the goal of
the IL is to offer instructional support for teachers throughout
their professional career paths. Novice teachers might receive
close-ordered coaching to help through the stresses of being new to
the profession. Tenured teachers might receive support in the form
of instructional development and experimentation. End-of-career
teachers might receive requests from the IL to share expertise with
others or to take on staff development responsibilities. At
whatever the career stage, the nature of the instructional support
will be in the form of developmental supervision or
mentoring.</para>
<para id="id3106413">Research on mentoring emphasizes that the
direction and content of instructional development is a shared
responsibility of both the novice teacher and mentor teacher
(Glickman, 2002; Reiman, 1999; Reiman &amp; Theis-Sprinthall,
1993). Through collaboration and coaching the pair of teachers
observe each other, share reflections on experiences, and develop
professional development plans. Although during the early stages of
the professional relationship, the mentor will likely assume a
dominate role; over time the nature of the relationship will shift
responsibilities from the mentor to novice (Gray &amp; Gray,
1985).</para>
<para id="id3106417">A key function of the IL is to identify,
develop, and supervise a cadre of successful teachers who are
trained in developmental supervision and mentoring. The IL will be
the lead mentor and will offer support and guidance to the cadre
and will also substitute in cadre classes when the mentor is
conducting observations or conferences. Each mentor will provide
reports to the IL regarding dates of mentor contacts, the nature of
the observation, and any issues that the IL might need to address.
Because of the need for confidentiality and trust in the mentoring
relationship, care will be given not to offer specific details of
the mentor’s contacts. The mentor’s contacts will be formative in
nature. Differently, the IL will conduct summative observations and
evaluations of teachers for employment decisions. The IL will offer
summary reports and recommendations to the MP and those reports
would become a part of the teacher’s personnel file. The MP will
also make recommendations, again for inclusion in the personnel
file, for employment based on teachers’ performances of
non-instructional responsibilities (e.g., bus duty, lunchroom
supervision, committee participation, attendance). The
instructional committee will receive recommendations and will offer
its recommendation for employment as well. In effect, employment
decisions then come upon a three-vote decision: one vote from the
IL, one vote from the MP and one vote from the instructional
committee. Based on the three reports, the MP will construct a
letter to the Director of Personnel that summarizes the findings
and will offer a recommendation regarding the continuing employment
status of the teacher. Both the MP and the IL will sign the letter.
Any disputes or dissenting opinions will also be submitted, as
attachment, to the Director of Personnel for inclusion in the
personnel file.</para>
<para id="id3180884">Although the IL would be responsible for the
personnel evaluation component, the instructional committee and
mentors would engage in supervision exclusively. The group based
the distinctions of what constitutes evaluation vs. supervision on
Nolan’s (2003) work. According to Nolan, the natures of evaluation
and supervision are fundamentally and critically distinct within
various functions of the teaching experience [See Table 2]. Given a
particular dimension, the distinctions between evaluation and
supervision become clear.</para>
<para id="element-880"><media id="idm2769232" alt=""><image src="../../media/table2.GIF" mime-type="image/gif"/></media></para><para id="id3196158">It is in the form of mentoring as a
supervisory practice that some of the more powerful benefits for
teacher growth and development seem to emerge (Reiman 1999;
Glickman, 2002; Pajak, 2002). Individuals who have a trained mentor
are more likely to realize professional and personal growth than
those who work alone (Vygotsky, 1986). This benefit is especially
noticeable when teachers are in new assignments or in new settings.
Whether we are speaking about new doctors, new teachers, new
administrators, or new professors, a supportive colleague can help
a novice move to higher levels of effectiveness. Writing about
medical school novices, Rabatin et al. (2004) noted that a
“mentoring model stressing safety, intimacy, honesty, setting of
high standards, praxis, and detailed planning and feedback was
associated with mentee excitement, personal and professional growth
and development, concrete accomplishments, and a commitment to
teaching” (p. 569).</para>
<para id="id3196162">For public school teachers having a mentor is
associated with professional growth and a sense of self-efficacy
for both novices and experienced teachers. In working with veteran
teachers, Reiman and Peace (2002) sought to “encourage new social
role-taking, support new learning in effective teaching, encourage
new complex performances in coaching and support conferences, and
promote gains in moral and conceptual reasoning. Significant
positive gains in learning, performance, and moral judgment
reasoning were achieved” (p. 597). Mentoring had a bidirectional
benefit for both novice and mentor. The best plan for supporting
instruction will require a position that is wholly, and singularly,
focused on the processes of teacher development.</para>
<para id="id3157015">As a benefit to school cultures, mentoring in
a developmental supervision model encourages conversation among
teachers. In conversation we begin creating a school community
characterized by sharing, supporting, and caring. It has become
clear through research of Noddings (2002), Palmer (1998), Starratt
(1997), and others that when teachers and students work in a caring
and supportive atmosphere, they are more likely to take risks,
experiment, and attend to each other’s needs. It is just this type
of collaboration that the process of mentoring can
encourage.</para>

illusion of something that is three-dimensional -- a form. Today
artists refer to light and dark areas of a work of art as modeling

<para id="id3184137">A Leadership Perspective:</para>
<para id="id3184141">The difference in management and leadership is
the movement from shape to form, from two-dimensional perspective
to a three-dimensional one. Leadership in many cases is a matter of
perspective. Effective leaders find ways to recognize different
perspectives in general through effective communication and more
specifically through active listening. Truly gifted communicators
can discern surface messages and distinguish them from the very
important, but embedded, messages. What is the speaker saying? What
is the speaker communicating? What is the speaker feeling? The
answers are often wide-ranging.</para>
<para id="id3205974">The form for effective school-based management
comes as effective communication. In other words, effective
management requires one to be able to see individuals, events, and
cultures from three dimensional perspectives. Communication has as
its prerequisite trust. Without a sense of trust between two
people, both in terms of content and confidentiality, there is
little hope of meaningful conversation. An obvious example might be
that if teachers trust their colleagues to work with them and not
reveal their weak teaching areas to the general public, and
certainly not to supervisors, then they might be more inclined to
share deficiencies with colleagues. In so doing, teachers might be
able to find help toward improving pedagogical gaps. If, on the
other hand, teachers do not have the confidence in others' genuine
concern for their professional development, they will certainly not
engage in conversation with people about any professional areas of
need. It is through active listening that principals can
communicate trust and genuine interest that might lead to collegial
interaction and growth.</para>
<para id="id3196990">Fortunately, active listening is a skill that
can be developed. Though many people might think they are good
listeners, in fact, without concentrated and frequent practice, and
perhaps training, few people are effective listeners. It is only
through intentional practice that one can develop into an effective
listener. And the truly good listener recognizes that communication
comes in verbal and nonverbal forms.</para>
<para id="id3170998">Effective leaders also recognize that through
empathic writing, a sort of active listening through writing, the
content of a message can begin to have depth along with breadth
(Kelehear, 2002). In other words, leaders see the message from the
front, from the side, from the inside. In so doing, the effective
leaders recognize the multi-dimensional dynamic, the
three-dimensional reality that comes with effective
communication.</para>
<para id="id3171002">Research on the role of effective
communication and the role it plays in successful leadership
proclaims that that there can be no leadership without
communication. In fact, it is communication that helps school
leaders build trust and integrity in organizational cultures.
Robbins &amp; Alvy (1998) assert that today’s principals are
expected to be much more than simply instructional leaders. Among
the multiple roles principals assume beyond instructional
leadership are chief financial officer for the school building,
student and teacher counselor for both professional and personal
matters, and community contact for topics ranging from dress codes
to the bus schedule. Embedded in all the principals'
responsibilities, both the de jure and de facto assignments, is the
requirement that they be clear and accurate communicators (Cousins,
1996). In fact, one might easily make the case that, above all
else, effective principals must be skilled communicators (Stevan
&amp; Blumberg, 1986; Zigler, 1994; Tauer, 1996; Cousins, 1996;
Reiman &amp; Thies-Sprinthall, 1998; Reiman, 1999).</para>
<para id="id3185929">In the spirit of skilled communicator,
effective school leaders are able to articulate the vision and
mission of the school and school system, establish norms of
behavior for both teachers and students, and communicate high
expectations for teaching and learning. There can be no effective
leadership, it would appear, without effective communication
(Persell &amp; Cookson, 1982; Buffie, 1989; Barth, 1990; Prestine,
1993; Blase &amp; Blase, 1994; Stolp &amp; Smith, 1995).</para>
<para id="id3204548">Particularly fascinating for today’s
principals is the possible role that technology, and in particular
e-mail, might play in contributing to successful communication.
With the infusion of technology into schools, computers and e-mail
have become part of the daily routine for principals and teachers.
In interviews with twelve principals representing elementary,
middle, and high schools, it became clear that both teachers and
principals relied heavily on e-mail to communicate with each other
(Kelehear, 2001). One principal commented that she no longer used
the intercom, but depended on e-mail to reach teachers and
students. She reduced faculty meetings from once a week to once a
month and disseminated all daily and weekly information by
e-mail.</para>
<para id="id3163502">Several principals also found that face to
face contact with some teachers seemed to diminish through the use
of e-mail, if not in qualitative terms, certainly in quantitative
ways. Two principals had actually removed the sign-in sheet and had
teachers sign in from their rooms via e-mail. They commented that
by moving the sign-in sheet they inadvertently lost contact with
half of the staff. Several other principals commented that if it
were not for the mail boxes in the front office, they would likely
not see many of their teachers. Or, as another principal lamented,
"I was talking with a teacher I had not seen in a few days when he
told me that he had been absent for two days. I did not even know
he was not there!"</para>
<para id="id3093248">And finally, there emerged the expectation on
the part of principals and teachers alike that an immediate
response to e-mail was not only preferred, rather it was expected.
When teachers and principals sent messages, they became annoyed
when the response was not returned quickly. When pressed by what
was meant by "quickly," the teachers expected the principal to
respond within three or four hours. Principals were more exacting.
They anticipated a response from teachers within the hour! Several
of the schools conducted faculty meetings whose agenda items
focused on establishing norms and expectations regarding
e-mail.</para>
<para id="id3173829">Given that e-mail has so completely become
interwoven into the fabric of the school culture, it is interesting
to note the reaction of staff when “the system” goes down or
crashes. One principal recounted her and her staff’s reaction to
such an event:</para>
<para id="id3205225">Last week the system stopped working. I sought
out our technology specialist in an attempt to find the source of
the problem. Almost simultaneously, teachers began drifting by my
office to tell of the problem and find when it might be fixed. When
I discovered that the system might be down for several days,
immediately my daily routine began to change. I traveled the halls
listening to teachers teaching and I talked with students as they
moved on to their next class. During the transition to classes, I
sensed that teachers were more likely to come to their doors and
visit with each other and with students than they were when the
system was working. For certain, I was in the halls more frequently
doing the things I think a principal should be doing.</para>
<para id="id3173576">It is far from certain whether e-mail alone
has encapsulated many teachers, but it is interesting to ask if a
reliance on technological communication necessarily detracts from
interpersonal conversation. Let it be clear, however, that not all
schools with e-mail become cloistered communities. In almost
countless ways, student academic achievement is augmented through
the proper application of technology. Nevertheless, there is a
possibility, as seen in the example above, that e-mail might reduce
the important informal contacts between principals, teachers, and
students.</para>
<para id="id3168307">Several studies support active listening as an
important set of skills for authentic and accurate communication,
especially for people in supervisory roles (Tauer, 1996; Cousins,
1996; Reiman &amp; Theis-Sprinthall, 1998; Reiman,1999). This
research applied active listening concepts to the medium of e-mail
correspondence, thus creating the notion of empathic writing. Once
principals recognize the pervasiveness of e-mail, they are left to
grapple with establishing effective communication habits through
that medium. Empathic writing might speak to this need.</para>
<para id="id3198365">Anecdotal evidence suggests that when the
principals paraphrased content or feelings with empathic writing,
teachers frequently responded with additional information, thus
developing the original message more fully. Teachers commented that
they appreciated the principals’ taking their comments seriously
and seeming to care about what the teachers were trying to say.
Interestingly, it became immediately clear that empathic writing
was rarely responded to in any substantive way if there did not
already exist a significant relationship of trust and open
communication between the principal and teacher. One possible
conclusion of this condition is that empathic writing is rarely
successful without a preexisting basis of interpersonal
communication. But, where that relationship was present already,
empathic writing by e-mail tended to enhance and affirm the
communicative relationship. Where that empathic precondition did
exist, teachers commented that the principals’ willingness to
respond to e-mail in an obviously meaningful way did indeed
engender trust and collegiality.</para>
<para id="id3202534">Some real limitations to empathic writing by
electronic communication emerged. With the loss of nonverbal
signals inherent in face-to-face communication, some of the power
of the principals' message was lost. More specifically, some
messages sent by principals were misunderstood because the teacher
was not sure of the principals’ actual intent. One principal noted
that many times silence or pauses communicated important, albeit
subtle, messages and that component was lost in e-mail. There was
just no way to display the “thoughtful pause” that might come in a
genuine, caring conversation.</para>
<para id="id3168365">Another principal acknowledged some benefit to
empathic writing, but was not willing to take the time, and risk,
that this type of electronic engagement required. With this
revelation as a backdrop, the writer stumbled upon a shocking
finding. Principals were literally overwhelmed by the volume of
e-mail messages that arrived daily. On the average, these fourteen
principals received 63 e-mails within a 24-hour period. If the
principals responded to every message utilizing empathic writing
skills, there would be little time to do anything else. Two
principals went on to say that they were reluctant to miss school
for professional travel because they so disliked the many messages
awaiting them upon their return. One principal put it very
directly:</para>
<para id="id3165006">This e-mail is killing me. When I arrived in
the morning there were always several messages from teachers,
parents, and central office personnel waiting on my computer. I
found myself arriving at work earlier and earlier each day so that
I could deal with these messages before teachers and students began
to arrive. Additionally, I stayed later in the day to catch up on
e-mails and other business that should have been handled during the
day when I was managing other e-mails. As a last resort, I began
taking my laptop home to respond to e-mails and found that there
was little time for me to be away from the affairs of schooling.
Managing these e-mails was burning me out. I was working fourteen
and fifteen-hour days.</para>
<para id="id3189381">As in many jobs today, it is interesting to
note that technology aimed to helping people work more efficiently
and therefore have more time for themselves has achieved the
opposite effect. The principals’ work is following them everywhere
and they feel overwhelmed. Today, there is a severe shortage of
prepared leaders to fill the leadership positions in schools across
the nation. There is the real chance that the very technology that
intended to make lives better is, in fact, draining the energy of
principals, and thus creating an increased leadership vacuum in our
schools. It would be important for further research to examine the
relationship of principal resiliency to e-mail management.</para>
<para id="id3159689">In the interviews conducted in this study,
another area of possible inquiry became clear. Do principals who
communicate well with personnel on an interpersonal basis find it
easier to engage in empathic writing than those principals who do
not relate well to staff members? From these few interviews, there
appeared to be a positive correlation between principals who
engaged in successful active listening and those who were
comfortable with empathic writing. Principals who had previous
training in active listening seemed comfortable translating those
skills to the writing medium. This is an area where closer study
needs to be conducted before any conclusions might be drawn,
however.</para>
<para id="id3181390">In reviewing material for establishing e-mail
messages, a potentially disturbing trend appeared. Under the
perceived urgency to respond to e-mail immediately, many teachers
found their lessons being interrupted by the frequent "beep" of the
computer, notifying the teacher of a new e-mail. As one teacher put
it, "We have replaced the intercom interruptions with computer
ones." Several teachers and principals set their computers to check
for new e-mail every two or three minutes, also saying something to
researchers about the school culture and technology. Have we
exacerbated an already fractionated, episodic school day with the
inclusion of e-mail technology in schools? It would be very
important, also, to examine to what extent teachers are responding
to e-mail during instructional time. Finally, how much time are
principals spending responding to e-mail versus their time
conducting instructional supervision?</para>
<para id="id3202176">Another area of concern for schools and
technology emerged from these interviews. Several principals
related that they believed that contact with central office staff
was decreased because of a heavy dependence on e-mail. Instead of
seeing the personnel director, or the superintendent, or the
curriculum coordinator, the principals and teachers received
memoranda via e-mail “almost exclusively” and the e-mail technology
actually did little to remove barriers or psychological distances
between central offices and schools. Several principals commented
that this separation might seem just the opposite of what ought to
happen with e-mail. Principals believed that the schools' morale
suffered from this exclusive reliance on technological
communication. Central offices often are accused of being
disconnected from students and teachers. There is a need to examine
this possible separation broadened by technology. Further study is
underway to clarify this apparent “entrapment” of central office
personnel by e-mail technology.</para>
<para id="id3190377">In conclusion, communicating by e-mail is not
likely to replace qualitative, interpersonal contacts. In many
ways, words without physical context can be hollow. Empathic
writing, however, can have many of the same benefits that effective
interpersonal communication has. It can provide another means for
principals to paraphrase teachers’ feelings and content and, in so
doing, enhance a sense of efficacy and trust among their
instructional staff. Empathic writing tells teachers that
principals care in significant ways about what is going on in the
teachers’ lives. Teachers can never have too many messages like
that from principals. It would seem prudent that principals work to
communicate well and often with their staffs through both personal
and technological contacts. Given that effective communication is
central to the form of effective building management and given
email continues to be an important technology for communication, it
stands to reason that building capacity for empathic communication,
either electronically or in person, is an important part of
successful leadership in today’s schools.</para>

instructional program conducive to student learning and staff
professional growth.</para>
<para id="id3191281">A Leadership Perspective:</para>
<para id="id3191285">When a teacher works alone he often has fewer
skills for problem solving than when he works with an older or more
experienced person (e.g., mentor). The mentor can help the teacher
explore different, and often new, ways to solve problems through
trial and error or through approximations of existing schema. For
example, if new learning is conceptually close to what the new
teacher already knows and understands, then he can more readily
internalize the information. If, however, the new learning is
significantly different from what is already known, then the
teacher will likely encounter more difficulty in capturing the new
information. In this case, a mentor can assist the teacher in
identifying new pathways of understanding. Mentors can enhance the
ability to internalize new and difficult material. The simultaneous
effort of support and challenge on the part of a mentor offers a
productive model for learning. For example, the mentor might
support learning by first presenting material that the teacher
already understands and then challenge him with information that is
an extension of that understanding. Put more directly, a teacher
learns best when learning is connected to existing understanding;
teacher learning is social in nature.</para>
<para id="id3148088">Understanding the role of space can help
leaders create learning places that are at once challenging and
supporting. Teaching assignments and the pedagogy that come with
them help create challenge. Leaders help teachers grow and stretch
by challenging them to take on different subjects, different age
groups of students, different roles. Additionally, leaders create
positive moments as they encourage teachers to use a wide range of
pedagogical techniques in order to reach more students. Left alone,
these challenges can create negative working conditions as teachers
feel stretched but not appreciated. Effective leaders find a way to
balance challenge with support. Much as space in art is constructed
with positive and negative dimensions, successful learning space is
constructed with a balance of support and challenge. The
appropriate balance might include new teaching methods, but at the
same time might include opportunities for team planning or for
coaching. Through sustained, long-term, coaching, and support,
leaders can offer teachers a safe environment where risks are
valued and mistakes are acknowledged as part of the growing
process.</para>
<para id="id3131469">School-based management, in part, is
successful to the degree to which that learning, amidst an
environment of support and challenge, is present for both students
and teachers. But bringing individuals and organizations to higher
levels of effectiveness is a daunting task. It is the position of
the author that organizational change can not happen without
individual change, and vise versa. A first step in making such
significant changes is to begin seeing teachers in a new way. That
new way is a view rooted in an arts-based perspective and
methodology.</para>
<para id="id3194703">The notion that school-based leaders can
assist teachers improve their effectiveness in supporting student
achievement is central to schooling. One of the most specific ways
that leaders can support teaching is through instructional
leadership and supervision. The author develops some of this
discussion in an earlier part of this monograph under shape. But
more needs to be addressed in terms of the possibility of leaders
capturing successful teaching and stretching growth of teaching
from an arts-based approach. Specifically, the author offers a
mechanism for applying the conversation of art to the art of
teacher development. Put differently, one might ask “How might a
leader build the art of reflective practice into the daily practice
of schooling?”</para>
<para id="id3204958">Reflection as a method for making meaning out
of the teaching experience remains an important part of
instructional supervision (Glickman, 2002; Pajak, 2003; Rucinski,
2005; Sullivan &amp; Glanz, 2005). Reflection as a method of making
meaning out of experience remains an important part of art
criticism (Feldman, 1995). Reflection as conversation is central to
making meaning out of the art of teaching. In as much as the
supervision of teaching becomes art, then some understanding of the
language of art is in order. In so doing, instructional supervisors
can begin to utilize reflection, as in art criticism, as a
mechanism for reflecting on teaching in a much broader and possibly
more profound way.</para>
<para id="id3204964">Focusing specifically on how teachers and
supervisors can reflect and discuss teaching behaviors, scholars
have readily acknowledged the role that reflection and feedback can
play in supporting teacher growth (Beebe &amp; Masterson, 2000;
Bennis, 1989; Bolman &amp; Deal, 2002; Dewey, 1938; Glanz, 2002;
Good &amp; Brophy, 1997; Kelehear, 2002; Lambert, et al., 2003;
Nolan &amp; Hoover, 2004; Osterman &amp; Kottkamp, 2004; Schon,
1987; Sullivan &amp; Glanz, 2005, 2006; Wenger, McDermott &amp;
Snyder, 2002; Woolfolk &amp; Hoy, 2003; Zepeda, 2000). The manner
in which supervisor and teacher talk to each other reflects the
capacity of both parties to recognize that teaching is about
supervisor and teacher as well as teacher and student. The
relationship that emerges from the conversation is beneficial to
both the teacher and the supervisor. In other words there is a
bidirectional benefit (Kelehear &amp; Heid, 2002; Reiman, 1999;
Reiman &amp; Theis-Sprinthall, 1993). But in order to understand
this bi-directionality, some consideration must be given to the
nature of conversation and how it can move from concern about self
to concern about others. The Concerns Based Adoption Model (CBAM)
provides such a theoretical understanding.</para>
<para id="id3190828">For several years, emerging in large part from
Fuller’s (1969) original study published in the American
Educational Research Journal, researchers in staff development have
provided an important mechanism for framing and supporting
organizational change through the CBAM (Hall &amp; Loucks, 1978;
Hord, et al., 1978; Hall &amp; Rutherford, 1990). The stages of
CBAM are Awareness, Information, Personal, Management, Consequence,
Collaboration, and Refocusing [See Table 3].</para>
<para id="element-843"><media id="idm2800704" alt=""><image src="../../media/table3.GIF" mime-type="image/gif"/></media></para><para id="id3162140">This theory recognizes that when individuals
come into contact with innovations, they necessarily travel through
the levels of concern (i.e., starting with awareness and moving up
the scale) based heavily on how “new” the innovation is. A
profoundly important distinction between the first four stages and
the last three is that the focus of the individuals moves away from
themselves and more toward the effect an innovation has on others.
Art conversation has some interesting parallels as well.</para>
<para id="id3162144">Edmund Feldman (1995) provides a paradigm for
discussing art publicly, i.e., art criticism. His four-step,
(description, analysis, interpretation, judgment) approach offers
students a specific process for undertaking aesthetics or critical
theory. When an observer engages an artwork using the Feldman
Method, that individual will first describe the piece. The goal in
this step is to describe objectively what one sees. An essential
part of this step is to delay any judgments or conclusions. The
second step in the Feldman Method involves analysis. In the process
of analysis one begins to describe different elements of the art,
like the use of color, or line, or value. The third step in the
Feldman Method calls for interpretation. The goal is to try to find
meaning in what one sees. The final step in the Feldman Method is
for the observer to begin making judgments about the artwork. This
step is the first one that calls for evaluation on the part of the
observer. Thus, if there is an art of reflection for teachers and
an art of reflection for artists, then there clearly is a message
for instructional supervision rooted in an arts-based
theory.</para>
<para id="id3190717">If an instructional leader begins to describe
teaching behaviors as art, one can observe that the same movement
from concern about self to concern about others also happens. To
put it differently, initially the conversation focuses on the
technical dimensions and afterwards addresses the aesthetic
elements of the lesson. In the first two steps the instructional
supervisor observes the lesson in its technical dimensions. The
observer describes and analyzes the lesson and these pieces are
very important. In fact, without first establishing that the
learner outcomes are met and that classroom management supports
that achievement it is premature to consider any other portion of
the instruction. If, on the other hand, the supervisor describes
and analyzes the lesson with a teacher, and they both feel
comfortable with those steps, then they can begin discussing the
instruction in qualitative or aesthetic ways. As in the description
of the Feldman Method above, teachers and instructional leaders can
readily engage in “describing” and “analyzing” a lesson but it is
quite a different story to “interpret” and “evaluate” the lesson.
The final two steps require the instructor and observer to attend
more carefully to the feelings, the consequences and the subtleties
of the lesson (Heid, 2005). But the final two steps are the essence
of beginning to observe teaching as an art and supervision of such
teaching as also an art. To ignore those steps is to continue
reducing class observations to inspection and “fact finding” rather
than enlarging the observation to the aesthetic possibilities of
excellent teaching. Given the important role that all four steps
play in promoting the art of teaching and the art of discussing
teaching, it is instructive to observe how using the Feldman Method
makes sense [See Table #4].</para>
<para id="element-636"><media id="idm9761024" alt=""><image src="../../media/table4.GIF" mime-type="image/gif"/></media></para><para id="id3190722">Applying the Feldman Method to artwork was new
for the instructional leaders and that newness helped remind them
of the power, intimidating power, of innovations. Applying the
Feldman Method in teacher observations was also challenging as it
was innovative for the administrators and for the teachers. The
author asked the same eight students to take their new knowledge of
the Feldman Method and apply it to teacher observations. Using the
chart above (See Table 4), the students began to be comfortable
with the different steps in the method. In pre-observation
conferences at their schools, they discussed with teachers the
specific points for observation and the structure of the
observation instrument. After each lesson, the observed teachers
were asked to apply the Feldman Method as they reflected on their
own lessons. In the post-observation conference, the instructional
leader asked the teacher to lead the conference by moving through
the Feldman Method. One of the instructional leaders came to class
one week and remarked: “I can not get my teacher to do the last two
steps. All the teacher wants to know is if he passed or not! We
just have nothing to talk about after we finish the technical
part.” Other participants also reflected similar concerns. In a
culture of high stakes assessment, of both students and teachers,
it is easy to lose sight of the aesthetics that impact learning and
to reduce learning to the technical or immediately observable
elements of a lesson. Toward the end of the term several of the
instructional leaders commented that their teachers, after they
began to trust the leader’s intentions, were becoming more
comfortable with discussing the aesthetic steps (i.e., steps three
and four) in the Feldman Method.</para>
<para id="id3196781">With each attempt to apply the Feldman Method
to instructional supervision, the students became more comfortable
applying the conversation of art in conferences. An especially
exciting part of this growing confidence and in keeping with the
CBAM stages of consequence, collaboration, and refocusing, the
students began considering different approaches to using art
language in observing teaching. As the students became comfortable
with the innovation later in the term, the author and students
began discussing the consequence the Feldman Method might have on
student learning and teacher growth. Their concern moved from
concern about self to concern about the innovation’s impact on
others. They also moved quickly to collaborate on possible
alternatives to the standard format the author proposed. And
finally, as a final project in the class, they were asked to
refocus the Feldman Method and formulate a new format for critique
so that they could make the assessment instrument meet the needs of
teachers and students at their schools.</para>
<para id="id3174804">Introducing school leaders to the language of
art, and in this case the Feldman Method, reminded the author and
students that innovation can be overwhelming. In order to come to
terms with innovation, school leaders must also recognize the
teaching the CBAM theory offers. A particularly exciting connection
for the participants and authors, and an unanticipated one, was the
link they made between concern for self and concern for others in
both the CBAM and Feldman Method. The message was clear: when
school leaders and teachers, in parallel fashion, begin attending
to the art of teaching, then they necessarily begin to move beyond
the important and necessary technical dimensions of teaching to the
crucial and essential aesthetic considerations that make a
classroom a place for academic achievement and personal
development. And in this context, creating learning space for
teachers invited experimentation, risk-taking, and a culture built
on teacher professional growth and student learning.</para>

<para id="id3200365">A Leadership Perspective:</para>
<para id="id3178241">As different colors contribute to the whole
beauty of the art and people’s different styles, different gifts
support successful schools. One of the ways leaders can celebrate
differences is by first acknowledging that diversity is valued.
This diversity can be in terms of gender or ethnicity, of course.
What might also be noted is that the diversity of ideas, teaching
styles, or perspectives is important to the successful school.
Successful leaders consider learning styles and personality types
as they seek out teachers’ help. Building a successful committee is
as much about “who decides who decides” as it is about who is in
the group. In other words, successful leaders help bring together
individuals with acknowledged differences so that a true exchange
of ideas can begin. The negative approach might be leaders who
select the “right” ones for committees knowing before the work
begins what the conclusions will be. Where leadership is successful
there are shared values and goals coupled with an appreciation for
the different paths one might take to reach those goals. One of the
more notable examples of these shared values amidst diverse
approaches can be in a principal’s role as instructional leader at
a local school high school. Specifically, how might the principal
support a shared value through staff development initiatives that
also celebrates diverse approaches to effective instruction?</para>
<para id="id3178246">No Child Left Behind (NCLB), for better or for
worse, has school leaders across the nation looking carefully at
staff development, especially as staff development affects the
notion of “highly qualified teachers” and “school improvement.” Two
questions that continue to arise among many school leaders are,
“How can we be sure that our money spent on staff development has
measurable results?” and “How can we sustain any benefits so that
our good intentions might last longer than just to the end of the
training session?”</para>
<para id="id3742562">Historically, leaders have created mission
statements and vision statements to help provide organizations a
means to articulate what they value most. As noted earlier in this
monograph regarding “space,” some schools have adopted a core
values approach school leadership. Core values help schools
communicate to the community, students, teachers and administrators
what is most important. It would stand to reason that the daily
activities within the school would support those values as well.
Principals have an especially important role in making certain that
what the teachers are doing is supportive and consistent with the
articulated core values. Additionally, in a time when much staff
development is being eliminated because of diminishing budgets,
initiatives must be able to communicate to various audiences their
value with specific and understandable assessments. And as leaders
begin to “justify” their expenditures for staff development in
light of NCLB, then they might return to what matters most, helping
children learn.</para>
<para id="id3774826">Even when a staff development program adopts a
core values approach, it will continue to find challenges to
implementing successful professional development. If on the other
hand school leaders couple core values with an intentional,
on-going reflection process, then they can greatly improve the
chances for successful staff development. One way that professional
development efforts can achieve desired results is by the
principal, teacher-leaders, and teachers answering affirmatively
the following seven questions about the staff development
initiative:</para>
<para id="id3192243">Given the core values of the school, have we
done the following successfully?</para>
<list list-type="enumerated" id="id3130412">
<item>Have we made all involved aware of the initiative?</item>
<item>Have we provided information about the initiative and how it

<item>Have we provided strategies for managing the initiative

<item>Have we communicated what consequence the initiative will

<item>Have we provided opportunities for collaboration among those

<item>Are we willing to provide opportunities for the affected
parties to work together to further extend and refocus the
initiative beyond its present form?</item>
</list>
<para id="id3180082">In order to achieve desired results of a given
staff development initiative, principals will answer, in order, all
the questions above. Only after one is answered adequately can the
next question be asked. Skipping or avoiding a question will
prevent the successful implementation of the initiative.</para>
<para id="id3161232">At a local high school, the principal was
considering various scheduling initiatives to support improved
standardized test scores. Early in the school year, before students
arrived, the principal and teachers agree upon the following core
value: “We value knowledgeable, reflective, and thoughtful
students.” At the school a committee, facilitated by the staff
development leader, then examined various scheduling models that
would support the articulated value. With district-level support,
the high school team committed to team teaching for math-science
and English-social studies.</para>
<para id="id3161236">The first order of business was for the
principal, with the collaboration of the high school committee, to
make the entire staff aware of team teaching. The leader then
provided information that clarified in what ways team teaching
supported the core value. Once the faculty had the team teaching
information, it began asking questions like, “What does this have
to do with me?” Individuals quickly moved to decide if the idea
affected them personally. Again, the leader shared with the faculty
how team teaching affected them. The faculty then imagined how it,
collectively and individually, would absorb or adopt team teaching
into its existing schedule. In other words, how would each teacher
manage team teaching? Up to this point, questions focused on the
teachers. When the faculty began to consider the impact of team
teaching on student achievement, however, then their concern about
the initiative moved from inward looking to outward looking. The
discussion about team teaching moved to the consequence on student
scheduling or student achievement. The phase revealed a significant
shift in the focus of the faculty. The faculty (principal and
teachers) ceased to think primarily of itself and more towards the
students. It is important to note that the faculty could not be
asked to consider the needs of the students until the first four
phases were addressed.</para>
<para id="id3167534">An especially exciting moment was when the
faculty moved to the next phase of concern and began asking
questions about how it might collaborate to further enhance the
positive benefits of team teaching. This level of concern
represented the best elements of site-based management and shared
decision-making. This level, however, served to remind reformers
that systems change is a multi-year challenge and that there are
few shortcuts. Finally, in very rare instance, this faculty began
to imagine how team teaching could be refocused or reconstructed to
be an even better strategy for enhancing the quality and quantity
of student learning.</para>
<para id="id3167537">For school leaders the message from the
example above was that as schools engaged in professional
development, they must attend to the needs of those caught in the
change in specific and intentional ways. And only after individuals
began to understand how they would manage the change could the
staff development move to its most important point . . . student
achievement. Understanding this process could help reduce
frustration and ambiguity amidst the storm of change. As NCLB
begins to disappear on the political horizon and the next “miracle
plan” arises, then school systems can be confident that they are
already attending to what matters most, helping children be
productive, reflective, and knowledgeable citizens in a global
society. Indeed, staff development can support high standards while
also supporting a range of approaches. When staff development, as
well as other school-based decisions, allows for shared values and
diverse approaches, then those efforts support the diversity of

<title>Texture: Feel or appearance of an object or surface</title>
<para id="id3186111">The Artist’s View:</para>
<para id="id3186115">Texture is the art element that refers to how
things feel or look as if they might feel. Touch and vision are how
we perceive texture. One can use tactile sensitivity by using skin
receptors to feel texture but one can also experience visual
texture by looking at the illusion of a three dimensional surface.
Once again the element of value comes to the forefront. Without the
relative lightness and darkness of the surface arrangement, the
illusion of a surface texture could not be seen. Texture is
important to every art medium.</para>

<para id="id3173374">A Leadership Perspective:</para>
<para id="id3173378">Successful school leaders recognize that
schools are a tapestry of people, interests and communities.
Weaving those very different, and very important, stakeholders is a
delicate and intricate process and will almost always result in
some degree of stress and anxiety for all concerned. When bringing
the various constituencies together, the school can become a
seamless fabric of diverse perspectives that agree to celebrate
student achievement. Or, if leadership does not effectively connect
the various stakeholders, the school can begin to unravel into
patches of angry parents, frustrated teachers, and misbehaving
students. Successful leaders take the time to invite participation
by all stakeholders. This invitation, then, would be offered to
parents, community leaders, students, teachers, administrators, and
support staffs. To the level that these constituencies are included
then there would be more commitment by all concerned and less
opportunity for subterfuge and negative energy. The notion that we
are all in this together would serve to elevate the commitment for
all and help create a fabric that embraces and supports rather than
a blanket that smothers creativity and individuality. In many ways,
the effectiveness with which leadership brings together the many
constituencies that comprise the school can be measured by the
safety and care that students feel in the day-to-day activities. In
other words, when we can imagine a school environment that
celebrates diversity of thought, perspective, and pedigree, then we
can draw comfort that the stress of expectations (e.g.,
standardized tests, NCLB, AYP) will not tear at the texture of the
school.</para>
<para id="id3861187">Watch a child enter a classroom for the first
time and one can see real stress. Observe a middle school student
“fumble” with the combination on a locker and one will see
frustration and sadness. Consider the novice teacher after his
first day teaching and one will see exhaustion. And then watch a
new principal conduct her first conference with angry parents of a
special needs child. She looks all over the desk for the child’s
folder (that is right in front of her) and then becomes embarrassed
when the parents point it out to her! Signs of stress again!</para>
<para id="id3199244">Everything we do involves some level of
stress. We wake up with it. We live with it during the day. And
then we try to sleep in spite of it. About the only way we can
avoid stress is to do nothing, engage no one, and think of no new
ideas. But it is Mark Twain who reminds us that the most tiring
thing to do is nothing because we can never stop to rest!</para>
<para id="id3188607">If we can assume for a moment that stress is a
necessary part of the school leader’s life, that it is in fact a
central fabric of the schooling process then we can begin the
process of embracing the energy that comes with stress and
thereupon help students learn, teachers teach, and principals lead.
Addressing stress for leaders in schools today, let us consider
three questions:</para>
<list list-type="enumerated" id="id3163966">
<item>What are the possible consequences of stress on leadership
style?</item>
<item>In what ways can stress affect morale and productivity among
principals and teachers?</item>
<item>What are some possible strategies for helping principals and
teachers manage change, and its accompanying stress, so that they
can support learning amidst difficult times?</item>
</list>
<para id="id3201477">In a recent article, Jerry Patterson and
Kelehear (2003) acknowledged that leaders create culture and that
they have a responsibility to change it. When leaders are in a high
state of stress, their leadership styles necessarily create a
culture that is under stress as well. Schools that function in an
atmosphere of unmanaged stress regularly begin to be dysfunctional
and unhealthy. Teacher attitude and morale deteriorate. Leadership
and teachers cease communicating. Students feel ignored and unsafe.
The whole place becomes “tired,” filled with frustrated and angry
teachers and students.</para>
<para id="id3180445">School cultures in tough times, like the
people in them, lose the ability to reflect and self-evaluate. The
negative energy associated with stress creates “blind spots” so
that what is clear to an outsider is ignored, or at least not
noticed, by those inside the culture. When the leadership’s stress
begins to change, however, then the school culture reflects that
shift. People are more open to critique. They communicate more
often and more accurately. Teachers and principals pay attention to
student needs more easily. Leadership absolutely affects a school’s
sense of wellbeing and efficacy.</para>
<para id="id3184061">It does not take us long to recognize the
source of much of the stress that many principals and teachers
face. Given the various calls to address safety, overcrowding,
drugs, gangs, low teacher pay, teacher retention, schools’
personnel can feel overwhelmed. Add to that stress the competing
demands of increasing assessments and reporting in a world of
decreasing funding, and we begin to see a prescription for
emotional, professional, and economic collapse. Specifically,
consider the pressure many principals and teachers are under as
they try to come to terms with being “highly qualified” and
achieving “adequate yearly progress ” (AYP) coming from the federal
mandate, “NCLB.” These are not easy times for schools. Leadership
style, school culture, teacher morale, and student performance all
suffer in a community where tensions are high and emotional support
is low. Uncontrolled, unidentified stress can drain the life-blood
of even the best schools.</para>
<para id="id3180163">When one walks into schools, the stress level
reveals itself almost immediately. One can watch a principal and
teachers and see that the way they interact with each other and
with students communicates the cultural undercurrent. Specifically,
the leadership style this author finds most often amidst stress
begins to be more about:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="id3180167">
<item>Fixed and authoritarian vs. flexible and democratic</item>
<item>Narrow and uninviting vs. original and embracing</item>
<item>Vertically focused vs. collaboratively aligned</item>
<item>Concrete and objective vs. abstract and subjective</item>
<item>Judgmental vs. encouraging</item>
<item>“My way” vs. “Our way”</item>
<item>“Hurry up and do” vs. “slow down and think”</item>
<item>Talking vs. listening</item>
</list>
<para id="id3100830">When the author examined morale in effective
schools, he quickly found the same sort of indicators in the
research literature as in anecdotal observations in the
neighborhood schools. The teachers talked to students and to each
other. Students felt safe and adults knew their names. The
principal was in the halls, talking to students and teachers. One
of my favorite places to visit had a principal who walked about
with an index card in his shirt pocket. As teachers and students
offered comments or ask questions, the principal took notes and the
next day, without exception, returned to the person with a
response.</para>
<para id="id3164635">As an instructional leader, another principal
engendered trust and understanding when she gave all her teachers a
“wild card.” The wild card was a small, colored index card that
stated: “This card entitles me to a day, free from observation,
without reasons or rationale.” The principal knew that there were
some days that, for reasons beyond the teacher’s comprehension and
control, things were not going well. When the principal appeared
for an observation, the teacher had the option of presenting the
card and the principal “turned on a dime” and departed the room.
All teachers received one wild card for the year. They appreciated
her realistic understanding and her support for their
teaching.</para>
<para id="id3121266">In coming to terms with the attributes of good
places to work, Buckingham and Coffman (1999) identify 12 questions
that receive a strong “yes” in organizations where employees have
high morale:</para>
<list list-type="bulleted" id="id3121270">
<item>Do I know what is expected of me?</item>
<item>Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work
right?</item>
<item>Do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every
day?</item>
<item>In the last seven days, have I received recognition or praise
for good work?</item>
<item>Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me
as a person?</item>
<item>Is there someone at work who encourages my
development?</item>
<item>Does my opinion seem to count?</item>
<item>Does the mission of my company make me feel like my work is
important?</item>
<item>Are my coworkers committed to doing quality work?</item>
<item>Do I have a best friend at work?</item>
<item>In the last six months, have I talked with someone about my
progress?</item>
<item>Have I had opportunities to learn and grow?</item>
</list>
<para id="id3155693">The message is clear: people want to work
where their humanity is acknowledged and celebrated. Likewise,
teachers perform better and feel more nearly positive about
students in schools where the principal takes a personal interest
in their professional development. And, when tough times come
along, then the principal, teachers and students draw strength from
relationships built on trust and empathy.</para>
<para id="id3161796">As leadership and teachers begin coming to
terms with stress and its related, albeit often unanticipated,
consequences they first notice that stress can destroy morale and
enthusiasm in the schoolhouse. In other words, unmanaged stress
debilitates teachers, students, families and dismantles their
learning communities. Leadership can, however, create and sustain a
school culture where student and teacher learning is the heart of
the matter. There are two, very specific elements for building
community within the varied texture of schools: Trusting
Relationship and Caring Communities.</para>
<para id="id3197819">Over and again, when I asked teachers what
they wanted in a principal they responded that they needed someone
whom they could trust. Leadership can build trust in a variety of
ways. Through effective and authentic communication, principals
engender trust by paying attention to the needs of teachers. One
principal with whom I visited recently devoted one half-hour of the
monthly faculty meeting to conversation. In that part of the
agenda, teachers discussed their needs, celebrated successes, and
then outlined goals for the coming month. The principal verbally
paraphrased the teachers’ comments and feelings, and in so doing,
checked his own perceptions of what was being said. Later that
night, he sent his notes in an email to the staff making sure he
had captured accurately what was said. Within two days, the
teachers delivered an email to the principal outlining one goal for
the month and the accompanying plan for achieving that goal. Also,
the teachers suggested one strategy that they would request of the
principal so that he could support their pursuit of the goal. One
caveat, and this was the really exciting part in the author’s
estimation, the principal encouraged teachers to include personal
goals in their plans. Although strategies for student achievement
and teacher effectiveness were always part of the discussion, the
principal also encouraged private or personal goals. The message
from the principal to the teachers: I value you as a professional
and as a person. In the end, a relationship built on trust emerged
and the morale and enthusiasm of principal and teacher alike were
bolstered.</para>
<para id="id3293479">Not unlike trusting relationships, schools
that are caring communities also support diversity and achievement.
Anyone who has taught in middle school recognizes the folly of
thinking that putting people into teams, alone, creates a
community. Even scheduling shared planning, although necessary, is
not sufficient for bringing teachers together. Creating a community
requires intentional acts in an atmosphere of caring amidst shared
needs and concerns. Leadership that provides teacher ownership of
the schooling process invites the cultivation of community.
Specifically, when teachers are given significant and real
responsibilities for running the school, when they are expected to
be aware of each other’s needs and to support each other, then they
begin to share needs and concerns. At one elementary school,
teachers began a process of deciding what mattered most to them as
a staff and then committed to supporting that belief in an
atmosphere of collaboration. It became clear, however, that
collaboration was not an option for everyone as some teachers were
working just to “stay afloat.” Recognizing this harsh reality, the
staff met again and reflected on what it was, specifically, that
got in the way of their being able to collaborate. In teams of
three, an individual teacher identified one obstacle and then two
other teachers committed to help address that obstacle. The
teachers took time to listen to each other. They, in their teams of
three, committed to helping each other address challenges each
month. Much of the conversation and support during the month came
in the way of emails and “accidental” contact during the normal
schedule of the school day. The threesomes did agree, however, that
some sort of contact was necessary at least three times a week. At
the end of each month, the threesomes gathered to assess their
status and to make plans for the next month. And all these monthly
meetings occurred as part of the regularly scheduled faculty
meetings. Although there were different levels of success in
becoming a school of collaborators, a sense of community and caring
clearly became the most important product of the initiative.</para>
<para id="id3128634">Leading is a lonely and stressful job. Given
that school leaders are daily handed increased accountability
amidst decreasing resources, it is no wonder that many are managing
stress that is compromising their personal and professional health.
The schooling we are doing today is far too demanding to go it
alone. When we can create school cultures that emphasize trust and
caring, places where teachers and principals see a shared
responsibility for what is going on in the school building, then we
can begin to survive the many harsh realities. Ultimately, it comes
down to celebrating a place where everything is about relationships
. . . about our individual “threads” of life that contribute to the
fabric of the school. If we as principals, teachers, and students
can tend to each other in a trusting and caring atmosphere, then we
can begin to attend to what matters most, the children in our
schools. And when that middle school child fumbles with the
combination on her locker, she will look to the adults in her
school as trusting and caring people who will help her through this
tough time</para>
<para id="id3171467">Conclusion on the Elements of School
Leadership</para>
<para id="id3188449">The elements of art juxtaposed to leadership
provide us with symbolic language for understanding what makes for
successful school leadership. As might be perceived in viewing
different art forms, some of the elements are more obvious or more
significant in one instance versus at another moment or place. Such
is the case with the elements of school leadership. Line, value,
shape, form, space, color, and texture all contribute to quality
schooling. Given one school with a certain set of needs, we might
find that shape is the leading element. At another school with very
different needs, however, we might find that texture is a focus.
But just as in playing a piano or singing in harmony, there are
individual strikes of the keys or notes of the harmony but it is
the collective, simultaneous action that elicits an effect that is
full, coherent, and complete. The successful school leader has all
seven elements at her command, albeit at different levels. Because
she understands the interrelated nature of the elements, she is
able to orchestrate a successful learning and teaching experience
for her students and teachers.</para>
<para id="id3188455">Using an arts-based approach to understand the
nature of successful school-based leadership helps craft an
enlarged view of what schooling might look like. It is not so much
that this approach is the answer to understanding all schools, but
such an approach offers one the capacity to view typical schooling
in a new and exciting light. When one continues to see the world
through the same metaphorical lenses, then one is likely to
continue seeing the same things in the same light. When, however,
one considers seeing schools from an arts-based approach then that
observer may very well gain a new insight into perplexing and
persistent problems. And in the final analysis, just as effective
teachers learn to see different students from different
perspectives effective leaders can see different teachers in light
of their different contributions. Maybe by considering the use of
line, shape, form, space, value, color, and texture one can open
his/her eyes to a new reality.</para>
